== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I retrieve custom fields for display on a category page? =

Use the function get_category_meta('field_name'), or alternatively, call CfsTaxonomy::get('field_name') directly, in your php.

= How do I retrieve custom category fields anywhere? =

Use the function get_category_meta() and pass it the term object as the second parameter, eg: get_category_meta(false, get_term_by('slug', 'good-stuff', 'category')). This will return all field data from the category Good Stuff. 

= How do I retrieve the cfs front-end form? =

Use the function get_category_form(). If used on a category or archive page it takes no parameters. It can be used anywhere by passing the term object as the first parameter.
